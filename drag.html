/* TODO: pure JavaScript drag and drop, with the following features:
 * 1. No library dependence, lightweight
 * 2. Allow to either click and hold, or click to attach to cursor, then click again to drop
 *   -- detect if was released in a source container droppable
 * 3. Apply a "hoverclass" to active droppables when active
 * 4. revertbounds: If within the area and not dropped on a droppable, revert it to its
 *    source. If outside, then notate cursor with a puff of smoke, and when released,
 *    destroy() the object. Would use for dragging pieces off a chess board during setup.
 * 5. Support touch events, too!
