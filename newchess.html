<h1>New Chess Variant Standards</h1>

<p>The following data formats are described here:
<ul>
<li>E-FEN, an expanded board position description format
<li>Extended Parlett, a powerful piece movement description language
<li>Algebraic Descriptive Notation, a concise and readable move notation combinging the best aspects of Standard Algebraic Notation and English Descriptive Notation
</ul>

<p>This document does <em>not</em> attempt to define the rules of chess variants themselves.

<h1>Expanded FEN (E-FEN) Specification</h1>
<p>This document proposes <em>E-FEN</em>, a superset of FEN, X-FEN, and Shredder FEN.

<h2>Precursors</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEN">Forsyth-Edwards Notation</a> was invented by David Forsyth (1854-1909), and later extended by Steven J. Edwards for computer use. FEN contains six fields which record the state of a chess game, including board position, castling possibilities, active color, and so on. White pieces are represented by uppercase letters, black pieces by lowercase. For example, in FEN notation the starting position of a standard chess game is:
<pre>rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1</pre>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-FEN">X-FEN</a> (aka FRC-FEN) extends FEN in several ways to support:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960">Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess, FRC)</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess960#Chess480">Chess480</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capablanca_chess">Capablanca chess</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capablanca_random_chess">Capablanca Random Chess (CRC)</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_chess">Gothic Chess</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embassy_Chess">Embassy Chess</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_Chess">Janus chess</a>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_chess">Grand chess</a> - 10x10 board
<li>... and perhaps more(?)
</ul>

<p>Notably, X-FEN allows an 8x10 board, adds support for encoding archbishop/janus/cardinal (knight + bishop) and chancellor/empress/marshall (knight + rook), in addition to extending castling possibilities indicated by the KQkq notation.

<p>Shredder-FEN is similar, but uses the starting file of the rook for indicating castle privileges (for regular chess, AHah would be used for full castling privileges instead of KQkq).

<h2>Piece Types</h2>
<p>E-FEN primarily extends the "board positon" portion of FEN, to allow for a large variety of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece">fairy chess pieces</a>

<p>The assigned letters and canonical piece names are are described below. Due to their
decentralized development, mythical chess pieces have many conflicting or synonymous names.
E-FEN standardizes on the names below. Piece movement is given in <em>Extended Parlett</em>. A
piece's movement must be representable in Extended Parlett before having a letter assigned. Like FEN,
uppercase is for white, lowercase for black.

<p>The X's can be extended indefinitely. Once XA-XZ are assigned, you can use XXA-XXZ, and then XXXA-XXXZ.

<p>A parenthesis after the initial X indicates a piece name follows, terminated by a closing parenthesis.
This allows for greater flexibility than assigning possibly obscure letter codes, if the pieces are even
more obscure. As a bad example, X(pawn) is a pawn. This would be most useful for custom designed pieces,
perhaps loaded from a file or other user data.

<p>The most verbose, but flexible notation is to enclose a |-separated key/value pair (denoted by =) of
the piece attributes in square brackets: X[image=king.gif|parlett=1*|royal=true]. This is to be used sparingly.

<h1>Extended Parlett</h1>
<p>Based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_chess_piece#Parlett.27s_movement_notation">Parlett movement notation</a>, with extensions
described on that page. Additionally:

<p>#foo "includes" the moves from the piece type named <var>foo</var>. For example, "#queen, #knight" combines the
moves of both a queen and a knight (the so-called amazon piece).

<p>~n/m is a special token representing all squares on the board, except where the piece is currently at. For all squares everywhere, combine
with ~0/0 for ~n/m, ~0/0.

<p>The "e" flag indicates that the piece can only move to the last square in the direction given, exactly not any less. For example, 2&gt;e means the piece must move exactly two squares forward, not one square, even though it is still a rider (cannot leap).

<p>"E" says to store the square behind where the piece moved, in a special global GAME_STATE.ep_target. This is used for pawn en passant moves. The two-move causes this variable to be updated, for example: oi2&gt;eE.

<p>"P", by itself, is a move to the en passant target square, as long as the pawn can diagonally move forwards towards it. See the pawn Parlett notation for an example. The pawn in front of the target square will be captured.

<p>The Extended Parlett notation is converted to a list of "raw moves", an array of relative x and y coordinates
(with (0,0) where the piece begins), along with various flags that describe under which conditions the move
is allowed. A relative move can be specified directly by using square brackets (which nest): [0,2] means 
that the piece can move exactly two squares forward. Positive indicates the forward direction, from the 
perspective of the active color.

<p>Flags for raw moves can be entered in brackets after a semicolon, with additional flags after another semicolon. A flag alone
specifies a true value: [0,2;initial_only] is the same as using the "o" flag. Flags can also accept relative moves
as values: [0,2;initial_only;if_unblocked=0,1].

<p>Braces add flags to arbitrary Parlett moves. Example: {oi2>;mark_ep_target}.

<p>Parlett only supports = for sideways moves. Extended Parlett adds &gt;&gt; for right, and &lt;&lt; for left.

<h1>Algebraic Descriptive Notation</h1>
<p><em>English descriptive notation</em> has several advantages over algebraic notation. Unfortunately, it labels pieces and squares based on chess1 pieces.
The pieces, from left to right, are named: QR (queen's rook, etc.), QN, QB, Q, K, KB (king's bishop, etc.), KN, and KR. The pawns in front of their respective
pieces are named as QRP (queen's rook's pawn, etc.), QNP, QBP, QP, KP, KBP, KNP, and KRP. If it is not ambiguous whether the piece or pawn is from the queen's
or rook's side, it can be abbreviated to just NP, BP, or RP. The pieces and pawn names can further be abbreviated to P, R, N, or B if those are also not 
ambiguous. The naming of the pieces is a desirable feature of English descriptive notation, but this method makes the notation unsuitable for chess variants
with different pieces or with pieces in a different order (Chess960, etc). Additionally, descriptive notation names squares by rank (by the perspective of the
active color) and the starting piece name on that file, with a similar disambiguation strategy.

<h2>Naming the pieces</h2>
<p><em>Algebraic descriptive notation</em> is similar to descriptive notation but names pieces as follows: origin + capital letter describing piece type. The
origin may either be a file, rank, or file+rank, or nothing: whatever is shortest and not ambiguous. Hence, the pieces in a standard chess1 setup are named:
<blockquote>
aR, bN, cB, Q, K, fB, gN, hR
</blockquote>

<p>The queen and king may technically be named dQ and eK, but if there is only one if each, they never need be named this way. Pieces can also be identified
by only a letter, if it is non-ambiguous, just as in English descriptive notation.

<p>The pawns, similarly, are named aP through hP. If multiple pawns (or pieces) are on the same file, they will have names based on the rank, or both file
and rank. A crazy screen chess setup might have pawns a3P, a4P, and others. Note that naming the pieces in this way is a feature that none of the algebraic
chess notations allow for. To SAN, LAN, CRAN, a pawn is a pawn, a rook is a rook, no matter where it came from, since pieces are only identified by a single
letter (and possibly their origin file and/or rank, before the move, but not the starting position). Algebraic notations emphasize position over pieces,
algebraic descriptive notation is just the opposite.

<h2>Naming the squares</h2>
<p>Algebraic descriptive notation names squares using file + rank. The file is identical to algebraic notation, and the rank identical to as in descriptive
notation. That is, the rank is from the <em>active player's</em> perspective. This is an important quality of algebraic descriptive notation: symmetry. Chess1
is heavily biased towards white. Losing as white is seen as "wasting a white" and black often will consider a draw a victory. Several chess variants attempt to
reduce the white bias, by 
<a href="http://www.chessvariants.com/d.betza/chessvar/fair1st.html">various means</a> (see also 
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Play-Stronger-Chess-Examining-Chess960/dp/0977452107">Gene Milener</a>'s "fair first move" rule). Symmetric rank
numbering also has the benefit of making it easy to understand symmetric moves. Thus the Épine Dorsale opening, 1. e4 e5 in SAN, or 1. P-K4 P-K4 in 
descriptive, becomes 1. P-e4 P-e4 in algebraic descriptive. 

<h2>Special moves and notation</h2>
<p>Castling shall be notated by O-O or O-O-O, capital letters, not zero digits.

<p>Checkmate is denoted by "#", as in algebraic, not by "mate". Check is indicated with "+", not "ch.". 

<p>Double check is denoted as "++", not "dbl ch". Double check is not indicated in algebraic notation, even though it is an important part of the game.

<p>En passant moves may be denoted by "ep", but it is not required.

<h2>Canonical moves</h2>
<p>To find out the moves in algebraic descriptive notation, first compute all the valid moves for the position. For each move, build a list of moves
of the following forms:

<p>
<table border="1">
 <tr>
  <th>Building blocks</th>
  <th>Example</th>
 </tr><tr>
  <td colspan="2" align="center"><i>Non-capturing move</i></td>

  <td>P-c4</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_aname + "-" + adescriptive_dest</td>
  <td>cP-c4</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_letter + "(" + adescriptive_origin + ")" + "-" + adescriptive_dest</td>
  <td>P(c2)-c4</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_letter + "(" + adescriptive_origin_rank + ")" + "-" + adescriptive_dest</td>
  <td>P(2)-c4</td>

  <td>piece_letter + "(" + adescriptive_origin_file + ")" + "-" + adescriptive_dest</td>
  <td>P(c)-c4</td>

  <td colspan="2" align="center"><i>Capturing move</i></td>

  <td>piece_letter + capture_or_dash + captured_letter</td>
  <td>PxP</td>

  <td>piece_letter + capture_or_dash + captured_aname</td>
  <td>PxcP</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_aname + capture_or_dash + captured_letter</td>
  <td>bPxP</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_aname + capture_or_dash + captured_aname</td>
  <td>bPxcP</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_letter + "(" + adescriptive_origin + ")" + capture_or_dash + captured_aname</td>
  <td>P(b4)xcP</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_letter + "(" + adescriptive_origin + ")" + capture_or_dash + captured_letter</td>
  <td>P(b4)xP</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_letter + capture_or_dash + captured_letter + "(" + adescriptive_dest + ")"</td>
  <td>PxP(c5)</td>
 </tr><tr>
  <td>piece_aname + capture_or_dash + captured_letter + "(" + adescriptive_dest + ")"</td>
  <td>bPxP(c5)</td>
 </tr><tr>
</table>

<p>After each move has been listed in each of the above notations, remove any notations that appear for more than one move.
This removes ambiguous notations. Next, choose the shortest remaining notation for each move. This is the
<em>canonical</em> move, the text which uniquely describes the move. All the remaining notations are
<em>synonyms</em> that should also be accepted as input, but not used as output.

<p>E-FEN piece letters may be accepted.
