<h2>Description</h2>

Checkmate your opponent's King (just like Western Chess)

	     <p>Most of the pieces
		 can optionally promote when they reach the last 3 ranks.  A piece
		 can also promote if it moves within or from the last 3 ranks.

		 <p>When a piece is captured it is added to the capturer's 'reserve', an
             army of pieces which can be reintroduced into play on the capturer's
             side (pieces in reserve are also said to be 'in hand').   Usually the pieces are
             all the same color, and the direction a piece is pointing from indicates
             which player it belongs to.   On any subsequent turn, the capturer may
             'drop' any captured piece (in its unpromoted state) onto a vacant square
             on the board, subject to a few rules:

		 <p><ul>
             <li>A Pawn may not be placed on a file that already contains a Pawn
		 <li>A Pawn may not be dropped with mate
		 <li>A Pawn, Knight, or Lance may not be placed on a square from which it
		 will never be able to move.
</ul>

<h2>History</h2>

Growing slowly in popularity outside of Japan, Shogi, the Japanese
            form of Chess, is perhaps the most popular board game in Japan, with
            perhaps a million active players.   Some early form of chess was imported
            into Japan (perhaps from Korea or Thailand), probably between the 10th
            and 12th centuries.   In the 16th century a rule was added (perhaps
            inspired by the changeable loyalties of mercenaries), allowing captured
            pieces to be re-used by the capturer, which sets shogi apart from all
            other chesslike games.   Other larger forms of the game have been recorded
            (up to the inconceivable 25x25 Tai Shogi), but these have largely died
            out, except for the 12x12 Chu (Middle) Shogi.    The Nihon Shogi Remmei
            (Japan Shogi Federation), formed in 1927, regulates play, conducts
            tournaments, and maintains player rankings.

<h2>Strategy</h2> 

Keep the squares in your camp protected to keep your opponent
		from dropping his pieces there.  In particular the squares around
		your King must be well guarded.   Middle game play is heavily influenced
            by play (and threats to play) from the reserves.    Watch for squares
            (on both sides) vulnerable to drops.    A good way to defend against
            a drop on a particular square is to move or drop a piece to that
            square yourself.  In Shogi, unlike Western Chess, material isn't so
            important once the Kings are attacked.  What is important is initiative
            or 'sente'; many games end in 'races' to see which player can mate the
            opposing king more quickly.

            <p>The relative values of the initial pieces may be: Rook - Bishop -
            Gold/Silver - Lance/Knight - Pawn.   Golds are slightly better than
            Silvers, especially for defense.  Lances and Knights are only useful
            for offense; since they are weak, they want to push forward and promote
            when possible.   Pawns are not worth very much until they approach the
            promotion zone, but a pawn in hand (i.e. part of the reserve of captured
            pieces) can be very useful.

            <p>The game is widely covered in Japanese books, magazines, and newspapers.
