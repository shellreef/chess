ALFAERIE OMEGA CHESS VARIANT IMAGE PACKAGE v0.9

This directory contains graphics from the amazing Alfaerie Chess Variant Graphics 
set, plus expansion sets. The goal is to include all known Alfaerie chess graphics
into one, flat archive. Instead of having separate downloads to add new images,
a new version of this package can be released when there are new images. Contributions
are welcome!
